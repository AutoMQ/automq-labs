# AutoMQ Labs

This repository provides a collection of samples to help you get started with [AutoMQ](https://www.automq.com), the next-generation cloud-native streaming platform, covering both open-source and cloud service setups.

## AutoMQ Open Source vs. AutoMQ Cloud

*   **AutoMQ Open Source**: A stateless KafkaÂ® on S3, offering 10x cost savings and scaling in seconds under the Apache License 2.0. Due to the nature of object storage, latency can be in the hundreds of milliseconds.
*   **AutoMQ Cloud Service**: Builds upon the open-source version with more shared storage options. It guarantees low latency consistent with Apache Kafka and includes commercial features like Kafka Linking for seamless migration.

## A Note on Software Versions

> The software versions used in the demos within this repository may be outdated. For any real-world use case, please use the latest official releases.
>
> -   **Open Source Docker Images**: Find the latest tags on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/automqinc/automq/tags).
> -   **Open Source Binaries**: Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AutoMQ/automq/releases).
> -   **AutoMQ Cloud**: View the latest version details in the [Cloud Release Notes](https://www.automq.com/docs/automq-cloud/release-notes).

## Overview

This repository is organized into the following sections:

*   **[Open Source Setup](./opensource-setup/)**: Deploy AutoMQ open-source version using Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and Ansible.
*   **[Client Examples](./client-examples/)**: Build and run demos for various language clients, including Java, C++, Go, and Python.
*   **[Table Topic Solutions](./table-topic-solutions/)**: Explore solutions for append and CDC scenarios with Table Topic, and integrations with Iceberg REST Catalog, AWS Glue, and Hive Metastore.
*   **[Cloud Service Setup](./cloudservice-setup/)**: Deploy AutoMQ cloud service on AWS (EC2 and EKS), GCP (Kubernetes), and Azure (Kubernetes) using Terraform.
*   **[Observability](./observability/)**: Set up a monitoring stack with Mimir and Grafana for AutoMQ using Docker Compose.
*   **[Kubernetes](./kubernetes/)**: Provides Terraform scripts for provisioning Kubernetes clusters on AWS, Azure, and GCP.
*   **[Kafka Linking Demos](./kafka-linking-demos/)**: Learn how to migrate from any Kafka cluster to AutoMQ with demos for standard clients and Flink applications.
*   **[Auto-Balancing Demos](./auto-balancing-demos/)**: See how AutoMQ automatically balances workloads based on traffic, QPS, and node health.
